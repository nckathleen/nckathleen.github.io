However, moves for my husband's job and having three children required several years as a stay-at-home mom.  Now I'm back and looking for a job as a junior developer / support engineer / product analyst in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area.\r\n\r\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleen-rauh-915b11104\r\n\r\nMy resume can be found[ here ](https://github.com/nckathleen/nckathleen.github.io/blob/master/KathleenRauhResume.pdf)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
